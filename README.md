# Water-Quality-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning


Water quality analysis is crucial in monitoring environmental health and ensuring safe
drinking water standards. This project leverages machine learning and data analytics to
develop a framework that assesses water potability based on pollutant data, such as pH
levels, hardness, total dissolved solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon,
trihalomethanes, and turbidity. By utilizing this dataset, which includes parameters linked to
water contamination and potability, the project aims to create predictive models to assess
water quality and identify nonQotable sources. Key pollutant metrics, including chemical
contaminants and physical properties, are processed to detect patterns associated with
unsafe water. The project's goal is to build an accurate and scalable model to forecast water
potability based on input pollutant levels, enabling proactive measures for water safety and
effective resource allocation in environmental management. Ultimately, this framework
could serve as a tool for communities and environmental agencies to monitor water quality
dynamically, promoting health and ecological sustainability.
